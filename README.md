## INTRODUCTION

This website is a project for my college portfolio project and it meets demand of a fully functional \
e-commerce website.

As an e-commerce website, it'll have a functional shopping cart and user authentication system for those\
who want to place their orders.

## WHAT INSPIRED ME TO WORK ON THIS PROJECT.

I love business logic and beleived that through tech, business problems can easily be solved. 

While studying JavaScript at simplilearn, one of the projects at the end of course was building a fully functiooning e-commerce website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I did enjoy every bit of the project and surely planned to work on my own project. I then chose python and framework Flask to make my website unique from that of Simplilearn.
I love writing the backend site of my app most, and to be honest I love database management which was not covered at simplilearn.

Though this project didn't completely come as I espected, it's even way better to me because never once at Simplilearn had I successfully finished complete app production.

## NEXT / FUTURE PROJECT:

For any similar project that I might work on in the future, i planned to use ***Odoo*** ( A management software with a range of business application)
